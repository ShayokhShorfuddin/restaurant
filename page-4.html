                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born
                    and I will give
                    you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
                    truth, the
                    master-builder of human happiness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who
                    do
                    not know how to
                    pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
                    anyone
                    who loves or
                    pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
                    circumstances
                    occur in which
                    toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
                    undertakes laborious
                    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
                    consequences, or one
                    who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
                    indignation and
                    dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded
                    by
                    desire, that they
                    cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
                    fail
                    in their duty
                    through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the
                    system, and expound
                    the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No
                    one
                    rejects,
                    dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself.
